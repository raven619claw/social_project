# social_project
Project to build a social network application
This is a dev project to learn and use different frameworks and technology
The path i'll follow while developing this project is as follows:


  1. set up express !DONE
  2. set up marko !DONE
  3. set up grunt watch task for scss !DONE
  4. structure code for server and client
  5. include lodash/jquery/zepto
  6. create dummy pages
  7. set up url routing
  8. set up babel
  9. study commonJS and AMD
  10. include webpack
  11. create API parsers for dummy data
  12. show dummy data
  13. set up  vue
  14. include database(sql/mongo/neo4j) for data
  15. show proper data
  16. implement ajax 
  17. set up dot.js for simple modules (maybe not if using vue)
  18. set up tracking interface
  19. set up view for viewing tracking data
  20. minify css/js
  21. set up cache server
  22. set up basic chat interface using socket.io

I have bare minimum knowledge on how to implement all this so i'll learn on the way.
If i have mentioned anything wrong do correct me on how to implement a feature
Will try to not use frameworks for front end and get by with vanilla JS
after i learn will replace all with frameworks

Credit to all ppl who have developed the modules that i will use
